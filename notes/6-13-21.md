# Reviewing failed runs from last night

After setting rules up for almost everything up to structure score calculations
last night I ran it and let it go overnight. Had multiple `dump_fastq`
jobs failed with same error message.

```
fastq-dump.2.10.0 err: timeout exhausted while waiting condition within process system module
```

Looks like [this page od the SRA toolkit docs](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/Network-and-Connection-Errors#download-sra-data)
is related. Timeout errors are common and toolkit will re-try some number of
times. In these cases looks like it just ran out of patience. Not sure why
though unless server disconnected temporarily? Don't think so because other
jobs also completed successfully in that same time period.

Increased `attempt` cluster parameter for dump fastq rule to 3.
