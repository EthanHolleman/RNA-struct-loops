# RNA-struct-loops
Probing nacent RNA secondary structure data in the context of R-loop formation.

## Background

*Alternative RNA structures formed during
transcription depend on elongation rate and modify
RNA processing* by Tassa et al introduces new high-throughput methods for evaluating RNA secondary structure and reveals
that increases in secondary structure may actually increase the splicing efficiency of introns. They devloped and
validated a "structure score" which indicates the degree of double stranded-ness at a particular site. 
We would predict that high degrees of secondary structure (high structure score) would anti-correlate with
R-loop formation. The pipeline in this repo attempts to evaluate that prediction.
